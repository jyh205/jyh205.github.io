essay called 'Coloring Life'. My initial analysis indicates I need to create a composition, and the user has provided a base draft, so I'll be working to flesh out the existing thoughts into a comprehensive piece. The next step is to examine the provided input.> **Identifying the Blockage**> I've uncovered the core problem: the user, Shaun, is experiencing a creative block. His draft hints at a desire to write about 'coloring life' but the process stalled. He's a tech-savvy 9th grader, likely around 14, and he's stressed and burned out, which is apparent from his inability to go beyond the opening, despite opening his code editor. He's now trying to get inspiration from his old Chinese textbooks.> **Mapping the Creative Landscape**> Now I'm focusing on the contrast between the creative desire, the 'Coloring Life' theme, and the frustrations of coding. The draft's imagery of the 'Little Peach Tree' versus the coldness of the 'Code Editor' are resonating strongly. I'm seeing a clear conflict: the user's struggle with complex debugging and algorithms like EMA and 1 Euro Filter is blocking his creative flow. He wants to find balance.> **Analyzing Potential Approaches**> I'm now examining different angles for 'Coloring Life.' Direction A suggests finding the color *within* coding itself, through those 'aha!' moments. Direction B leans towards finding color outside coding, then bringing it back, while Direction C positions the coder as a creator. I'm leaning toward combining aspects of B and C, weaving in the 'Little Peach Tree' to show resilience.> **Outlining the Core Elements**> I'm now outlining the essay's structure. Body paragraph one will describe the coding process as a gray, uncolored canvas, highlighting the technical details like the IDE, the '1 Euro Filter,' and the 'boring debugging.' Paragraph two focuses on applying color, perhaps through the moment of success or by seeing persistence as the color, like the peach tree weathering a storm. Finally, the third paragraph will explore the philosophy of 'coloring,' injecting passion into the mechanical and finding humanity in tech. My code is now like my peach blossom.> **Developing the Essay's Voice**> I'm now refining the essay's persona. I plan to validate Shaun's coding 'handwriting' to acknowledge his personality, and using his tech vocabulary (EMA, 1 Euro) helps to root the essay in his reality. I'm focusing on weaving in the 'Little Peach Tree' to represent his struggle, which mirrors the challenges of getting his project, AirMouse, to work.> **Synthesizing Themes & Structure**> My focus has shifted to connecting the 'Peach Tree' bloom to project success. I'm also now reviewing the composition against the constraints of a 9th-grade level, aiming for an encouraging and technical yet literary tone. I need to weave in Shaun's work on AirMouse/MediaPipe. Furthermore, I've realized I must be specific. Generic templates won't work. I'm now thinking of Shaun's 'EMA' and '1 Euro' as the thick logic that blooms into something beautiful. This concept of filtering code noise is like filtering life's frustrations to find peace, which feels like a strong angle.\n\nShaun\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u8349\u7a3f\u5f88\u6709\u610f\u601d\uff01\u4f60\u8bd5\u56fe\u5c06**\u201c\u8bed\u6587\u8bfe\u672c\u91cc\u7684\u611f\u6027\uff08\u5c0f\u6843\u6811\uff09\u201d**\u4e0e**\u201c\u786c\u6838\u79d1\u6280\u7684\u7406\u6027\uff08\u4ee3\u7801/\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u201d**\u7ed3\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1768101141, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.com/favicon.ico", "createdDate": "2026-01-11", "dateLabelColor": "#1f883d"}, "P12": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/wei-sheng-ming-shang-se.html", "labels": ["\u81ea\u521b"], "postTitle": "\u4e3a\u751f\u547d\u4e0a\u8272", "postUrl": "post/wei-sheng-ming-shang-se.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/jyh205/jyh205.github.io/issues/12", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 834, "description": "\u8fd9\u5468\u516d\uff0c\u8001\u5e08\u7a81\u7136\u5ba3\u5e03\uff0c\u5e26\u540c\u5b66\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u767b\u9f9f\u5c71\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1768706624, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.com/favicon.ico", "createdDate": "2026-01-18", "dateLabelColor": "#1f883d"}, "P13": {"htmlDir": "docs/post/mei-rang-sheng-huo-geng-feng-ying.html", "labels": ["\u81ea\u521b"], "postTitle": "\u7f8e\u8ba9\u751f\u6d3b\u66f4\u4e30\u76c8", "postUrl": "post/mei-rang-sheng-huo-geng-feng-ying.html", "postSourceUrl": "https://github.com/jyh205/jyh205.github.io/issues/13", "commentNum": 0, "wordCount": 805, "description": "\u521d\u4e09\u7684\u751f\u6d3b\uff0c\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u5f20\u88ab\u8bd5\u5377\u586b\u6ee1\u7684\u9ed1\u767d\u8349\u7a3f\u7eb8\uff0c\u6bcf\u5929\u9664\u4e86\u5237\u9898\u5c31\u662f\u80cc\u8bf5\uff0c\u65e5\u5b50\u8fc7\u5f97\u7d27\u7ef7\u800c\u5355\u8c03\u3002", "top": 0, "createdAt": 1768706947, "style": "", "script": "", "head": "", "ogImage": "https://github.com/favicon.ico", "createdDate": "2026-01-18", "dateLabelColor": "#1f883d"}}, "singeListJson": {}, "labelColorDict": {"A new start": "#4F12C9", "A \u8303": "#f9d0c4", "AI": "#300856", "AI-answer": "#fe01ed", "good first issue": "#7057ff", "\u81ea\u521b": "#62B78D", "\u8f6c\u8f7d": "#16fb36"}, "displayTitle": "Jyh", "faviconUrl": "https://github.com/favicon.ico", "ogImage": "https://github.com/favicon.ico", "primerCSS": "<link href='https://mirrors.sustech.edu.cn/cdnjs/ajax/libs/Primer/21.0.7/primer.css' rel='stylesheet' />", "homeUrl": "https://jyh205.github.io", "prevUrl": "disabled", "nextUrl": "disabled"}
